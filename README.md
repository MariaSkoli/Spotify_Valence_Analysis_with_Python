# Spotify_Valence_Analysis_with_Python

The aim of this assignment is to dissect Spotify's Valence metric.
Valence is a metric to measure the happiness of a track. It is measured with values between 0 and 1. Î¤he closer a tracks' valence is to 1 means that someone feels happy. On the other side, closer to 0 means that someone feels sad.   

* The main goal of our analysis is to find the attributes that influence the `valence` of a track.

This assignment is divided into 4 sections:
